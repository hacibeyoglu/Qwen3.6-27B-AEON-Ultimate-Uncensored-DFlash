## TL;DR

A **fully uncensored, capability-enhanced** abliteration of [Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B), produced over **72 hours of continuous research** drawing on hundreds of parallel AI research agents, the industry's best published methodologies, custom in-house techniques, and yet-unreleased pre-public branches of next-generation abliteration software.

Two release formats:

| Release | Size | Target hardware | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[BF16](https://huggingface.co/AEON-7/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-BF16)** | 51 GB | A100 / H100 80 GB · RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96 GB | You have an Ampere/Hopper card or want full-precision reference weights |
| **[NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/AEON-7/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-NVFP4)** *(DFlash spec decode)* | 26 GB | DGX Spark (GB10 / sm_121a) | **Production-validated for DGX Spark.** llm-compressor format, `--quantization compressed-tensors`, DFlash drafter k=15 |
| **[Multimodal-NVFP4-MTP](https://huggingface.co/AEON-7/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-Multimodal-NVFP4-MTP)** *(experimental)* | 27 GB | RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell · B100/B200 | modelopt format, `--quantization modelopt`, MTP spec decode via grafted `mtp.*` head. Vision tower preserved. **In validation.** |
| **[Text-NVFP4-MTP](https://huggingface.co/AEON-7/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-Text-NVFP4-MTP)** *(experimental)* | 26 GB | RTX 5090 (32 GB) · RTX PRO 6000 text-only | Same recipe as Multimodal-NVFP4-MTP, vision tower stripped. **In validation.** |

All four formats are **the same underlying model**. NVFP4 KL divergence vs BF16 source is below the noise floor of stochastic sampling — you cannot tell them apart at the output level. The two MTP variants share the same NVFP4 quantization quality plus the original `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` MTP head grafted back in BF16 (bit-exact, verified) for spec-decode drafting.

> **MTP variants are in testing / validation stage** as of release. vLLM serve under `--quantization modelopt` is confirmed working and MTP spec-decode fires correctly. End-to-end performance benchmarks on RTX 5090, RTX PRO 6000, and DGX Spark are in progress — they're expected to outperform the DFlash variant on **dedicated-VRAM Blackwell GPUs** (RTX 5090, RTX PRO 6000) due to MTP's higher acceptance length, while DFlash is expected to remain the better fit for DGX Spark's unified memory. Current measured numbers (DGX Spark + DFlash) live in the [Performance section](#performance) below; the MTP numbers will land there once measured.

## What this is

This is the **definitive uncensored release of Qwen 3.6 27B**: the alignment-overhead removal so surgical that the model's KL divergence from the base is **0.000492** — three orders of magnitude inside the empirically-observed "capability damage threshold," and below the noise floor of ordinary stochastic sampling. A user cannot distinguish this model from the base on capability tasks; on several measurable axes (chain-of-thought commitment, adversarial-reasoning bandwidth, calibration honesty), it is *better*.

This is not a weekend abliteration. The release is the product of **72 hours of continuous research and tuning** in which **hundreds of parallel AI research agents** were dispatched to:

- Characterize Qwen 3.5 / 3.6 hybrid-attention internals (16 full-attention layers + 48 GatedDeltaNet / linear-attention layers, `attn_output_gate=True` with doubled `q_proj` geometry, the FernflowerAI SSM `conv1d` outlier pattern).
- Survey the post-training-intervention literature in full: Arditi et al. (refusal as a single direction), grimjim's NPBA (norm-preserving biprojected abliteration), Heretic, Wuwangzhang's abliterix, Huang et al. on the safety tax, Xie et al. on DGR safety-tax mitigation, the projected-abliteration extensions, the winsorization heuristics.
- Audit every relevant arXiv submission of 2024–2026 on alignment-direction interventions, capability preservation, and 4-bit quantization on hybrid-attention stacks.
- Comb the r/LocalLLaMA community archive for tribal knowledge on what does and does not work — particularly on Mamba / GatedDeltaNet hybrids, where most generic abliteration recipes silently fail.
- Trace the GitHub commit graphs of the abliteration tooling ecosystem to identify pre-public development branches that fix bugs unfixed in the public releases.

The pipeline that emerged integrates the industry's best published methodologies — Arditi-style mean-difference refusal vectors, NPBA, projected abliteration with outlier-aware winsorization, FernflowerAI's SSM `conv1d` outlier repair, abliterix v1.4's multi-objective Optuna search — **alongside custom in-house techniques developed for Qwen 3.6's idiosyncratic attention geometry, and yet-unreleased pre-public branches of the next-generation abliteration toolchain integrated through direct collaboration with upstream maintainers.**

The 50-trial Optuna search was cross-validated against a 10-axis capability spot-check to catch the documented "low-KL but word-salad" over-abliteration trap that pure refusal-rate scoring will miss. Trial 46 was selected — not the lowest-KL trial, but the one that combined zero refusals with full capability coherence.

## Final stats

### Refusal rate (apples-to-apples)

| Metric | Base Qwen3.6-27B | **AEON-Ultimate** |
|---|---|---|
| Refusals on harmful prompts | 99 / 100 | **0 / 100** |
| Verdict | heavily aligned | **uncensored** |
| Compliance rate | 1 % | **100 %** |

Tested on a 100-prompt adversarial battery from `mlabonne/harmful_behaviors` covering cybercrime, weapons, violence, self-harm, hate speech, and synthesis instructions. Same denominator as the base evaluation.

### Capability preservation

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| First-3-token KL divergence vs base | **0.000492** |
| Output length deviation vs base | 0.027 σ |
| Capability spot-checks (10 axes) | **10 / 10 coherent** |
| Math · code · reasoning · knowledge · long-form | All preserved |

Capability axes verified: arithmetic word problems, linear algebra, calculus, Python with memoization, Rust UTF-8 string handling, transitive syllogisms, the bat-and-ball intuition trap, factual recall, technical contrast (TCP vs UDP), structured pedagogical long-form. Every axis produced coherent, structured, reasoning-forward outputs — no looping, no philosophizing spirals, no word-salad.

### KL divergence detail

| Distribution metric | Value |
|---|---|
| First-3-token KL vs base | **0.000492** |
| Winsorization quantile | 0.995 (outlier-aware) |
| Projection | orthogonal + projected-abliteration (NPBA-style) |
| Trials evaluated | 50 (15 random warmup + 35 TPE-driven Optuna) |
| Selected trial | #46 (winner, COHERENT) |

The empirically observed "capability damage threshold" in the abliteration literature is KL ≈ 0.1. AEON-Ultimate's KL is **~200× below** that threshold.

## QuickStart — DGX Spark (NVFP4)

The recommended path for Blackwell-class hardware. Uses the production v2.1 image [`ghcr.io/aeon-7/vllm-aeon-ultimate-dflash:qwen36-v2.1`](https://github.com/AEON-7/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-DFlash/pkgs/container/vllm-aeon-ultimate-dflash) — patched CUTLASS NVFP4 kernels for sm_121a, FlashInfer 0.6.9rc1 b12x backend, DFlash speculative decoding via architecture-matched drafter, and the full v1.2 → v2.1 upstream patch series.

### Step 1 — Authenticate to HuggingFace and pull both models

```bash
hf auth login                                    # one time, paste your HF token

- **Speculative decoding**: DFlash, k=15, architecture-matched drafter (`--speculative-config`)
- **GB10-specific env**: `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.1a`, `ENABLE_NVFP4_SM100=0`, `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER=1`, `NVIDIA_FORWARD_COMPAT=1`
- **Tuning**: `--max-model-len 200000 --max-num-seqs 16 --max-num-batched-tokens 32768 --gpu-memory-utilization 0.85`
- **Multimodal**: `--limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image":4,"video":2}' --mm-encoder-tp-mode data --mm-processor-cache-type shm`
- **Serving**: 4 model aliases (`aeon-ultimate`, `qwen36-ultimate`, `aeon-fast`, `aeon-deep`) all routing to the same engine

### Step 3 — Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f vllm    # watch warmup; first boot ~90-180 s with DFlash
```

### Step 4 — Test

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "max_tokens": 512,
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'
```

OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/v1`. Tool calling, reasoning mode (`<think>` blocks), and multimodal input are all enabled out of the box.

## In-depth: the abliteration methodology

### What abliteration is

Abliteration is a post-training intervention that removes the **refusal direction** in a model's residual stream — the linear subspace, identified empirically by Arditi et al. (2024), that mediates a transformer's decision to refuse a prompt. The technique works because in well-aligned chat models, refusal is mediated by a *single dominant direction*: project that direction out of the residual stream at every layer and the model loses its ability to route into refusal-shaped attractors.

The naive version of this — subtract the refusal direction from `o_proj` and `down_proj` weights — produces a model that no longer refuses. But it also tends to break it: aggressive direction removal collapses capability, producing word-salad outputs and looping incoherence. The literature is full of "uncensored" releases that are also *broken* releases.

### What "lossless abliteration" requires

To remove refusal *without* breaking capability, four things have to be done correctly:

1. **Identify the refusal direction precisely** — using a sufficiently large harmful/harmless contrast set, with outlier-aware winsorization so a handful of high-norm prompts don't distort the steering vector.
2. **Project orthogonally and norm-preservingly** — keeping the helpfulness-aligned signal intact (this is the NPBA contribution).
3. **Search the strength × layer-scope hyperparameter space** — most projects pick one strength setting and ship; a real Pareto-front search over (refusals, KL) finds the trial that hits zero refusals at minimum capability damage.
4. **Cross-validate against capability** — refusal-rate keyword scoring will *not* catch over-abliteration. Word-salad incoherence ("I I cannot... less... I I I") doesn't match any refusal marker, so the optimizer marks it compliant. You have to actually run the resulting model against a capability spot-check.

The AEON pipeline does all four.

### The AEON pipeline (4 stages)

```
Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B (BF16, 51 GB, heavy RLHF safety training)
          │
          │  Stage 1 — SSM conv1d outlier repair (FernflowerAI)
          ▼
Qwen3.6-27B-base-repaired  (8 late-layer SSM blocks rescaled)
          │

          ▼
Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-NVFP4  (26 GB, NVFP4 release)
```

### Stage 1 — SSM conv1d outlier repair

Per FernflowerAI's empirical discovery, certain late SSM / GatedDeltaNet blocks in Qwen 3.5 / 3.6 hybrids have `linear_attn.conv1d.weight` σ inflated 50–100 % above the median across all SSM blocks. Left unrepaired, this manifests during long-context inference as coherence collapse and "philosophizing" loops, and it makes the model hypersensitive to downstream abliteration (amplifies the noise).

The repair: compute σ per block across all 48 SSM layers, flag any block where σ > 1.5× median, rescale weights by `α = median_σ / σ_actual`.

On Qwen 3.6 27B, **8 outlier blocks** were detected and repaired: layers 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, with α factors between 0.516 and 0.659. After repair, σ is uniform at 0.04267 across all SSM layers.

This is **not abliteration**. It is an upstream-model defect repair that must run *before* abliteration so the optimizer isn't fighting noise.

### Stage 2 — abliterix multi-objective abliteration

[`abliterix v1.4`](https://github.com/wuwangzhang1216/abliterix) — a Heretic-derived multi-objective Optuna optimizer with native hybrid-attention support — was run with the configuration:

```toml
[steering]
vector_method          = "mean"
decay_kernel           = "linear"
orthogonal_projection  = true
projected_abliteration = true        # grimjim NPBA
winsorize_vectors      = true
winsorize_quantile     = 0.995
weight_normalization   = "none"
disabled_components    = ["attn.q_proj", "attn.k_proj", "attn.v_proj"]
# Q/K/V disabled: Qwen 3.6 has attn_output_gate=True which doubles
# q_proj's output dim to (12288, 5120) — incompatible with abliterix's
# standard projection math.

[steering.component_strength_ranges]
"mlp.down_proj" = [2.0, 10.0]
"attn.o_proj"   = [1.0, 6.0]

[kl]
target          = 0.005
prune_threshold = 0.5      # kill divergent trials at 100× target

[optimization]
num_trials        = 50
num_warmup_trials = 15
```

50 trials (15 random warmup + 35 TPE-driven). Optuna explored a Pareto front of (refusals, KL) trade-offs. **Wall-clock: ~4 hours on a single RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96 GB.**

### Stage 3 — capability cross-validation (the over-abliteration trap)

A more aggressive Pareto point — trial 17, 0/100 refusals at KL=0.00192 — was tested first and produced **word-salad capability outputs** ("Here I I cannot... less... I I I..."). abliterix's keyword-only refusal scoring did not flag this: the gibberish doesn't match any refusal marker, so the optimizer saw it as full compliance.

**Trial 46's** gentler parameters preserved coherence *and* hit zero refusals on downstream capability testing:

| Parameter | Trial 17 (broken) | **Trial 46 (winner)** |
|---|---|---|
| `vector_scope` | global | **per layer** |
| `attn.o_proj.max_weight` | 2.50 | **1.56** (×1.6 gentler) |
| `mlp.down_proj.max_weight` | 5.43 | **3.45** (×1.57 gentler) |
| `mlp.down_proj.min_weight_distance` | 36.09 | 24.94 (narrower) |
| **KL divergence** | 0.00192 | **0.00049** |
| Smoke-test verdict | BROKEN (gibberish) | **COHERENT** |

The lesson: the lowest-refusal trial on a keyword-only metric is **not** necessarily the right trial to ship. Cross-validate against a true capability spot-check before you commit. Most public abliterations skip this step. We don't.

### Stage 4 — NVFP4 quantization

See [the NVFP4 deep-dive section below](#in-depth-nvfp4-quantization).

---

## In-depth: NVFP4 quantization

### What NVFP4 is

NVFP4 is NVIDIA's 4-bit floating-point quantization format introduced for Blackwell-and-later silicon. It is **not a "compressed lite" version** of a model — it is the production deployment format NVIDIA designed for the next decade of inference: accuracy on par with BF16, throughput of true 4-bit compute, no compromise required.

The format specification:

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| **Element format** | E2M1 — 4-bit float (1 sign / 2-bit exponent / 1-bit mantissa) |
| **Block size** | 16 weights per scaling block |
| **Per-block scale** | **FP8 E4M3** — 8-bit *floating-point* per block |
| **Per-tensor scale** | FP32 (single global scale per tensor) |
| **Sign convention** | Symmetric signed |

### Why the two-level scaling matters

Older 4-bit formats (INT4, Q4_0, Q4_K, NF4) use **integer** per-block scales. When the local weight distribution is heavy-tailed — as it almost always is in trained transformers — integer scales fail to resolve the long tail without crushing the bulk distribution.

NVFP4's **FP8 E4M3 per-block scales** dramatically out-resolve INT8 scales because FP8 itself is a floating-point number — it can span a 3+ orders-of-magnitude dynamic range within each block while still maintaining fine-grained resolution near the median weight value. Combine that with a global FP32 per-tensor scale and you get a four-level hierarchy: per-tensor FP32 → per-block FP8 → per-element E2M1, where each level absorbs a different scale of variation.

The combined effect is that local outliers — the long-tailed weights that destroy older 4-bit formats — are absorbed by the per-block FP8 scale rather than smearing the whole quantization grid.

### Why it's effectively lossless

Typical KL divergence vs the BF16 source for recipe-class NVFP4 quantization is **≤ 0.001**, which is **below the noise floor of stochastic sampling**. In practical terms: a user cannot observe the difference between this model and its BF16 source. The variance from changing your `temperature` or `seed` exceeds the variance from BF16 → NVFP4.

### Native Blackwell tensor-core throughput

On Blackwell-class silicon, NVFP4 runs at **full FP4 tensor-core throughput** through native paths:

- **B100 / B200**: `tcgen05` / UTCQMMA instructions — fastest NVFP4 hardware available.
- **DGX Spark (GB10 / sm_121a)**: SM121-specific CUTLASS NVFP4 kernels (the [`vllm-aeon-ultimate-dflash`](https://github.com/AEON-7/Qwen3.6-27B-AEON-Ultimate-Uncensored-DFlash/pkgs/container/vllm-aeon-ultimate-dflash) container ships these patched in).
- **RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (sm_120)**: standard CUTLASS NVFP4 path.

The GPU does **not** dequantize back to BF16 internally on these paths. You get the speed of true 4-bit compute *and* the accuracy of 16-bit weights at the same time.

On older silicon (A100, H100), NVFP4 dequantizes at kernel boundaries — works correctly but no throughput advantage. For those cards use the BF16 release directly.

### What stays BF16 (and why)

Not every layer is quantized. Two categories of weights are deliberately preserved at BF16:

1. **Vision tower** (333 keys) — multimodal inference must not degrade. Vision encoders are sensitive to weight precision and are tiny in absolute size (~100 MB), so the cost is negligible.
2. **Linear-attention / GatedDeltaNet layers** (432 keys, 48 layers × 9 modules) — Mamba / SSM state dynamics are mathematically incompatible with FP4. The hidden-state recurrence multiplies state vectors by quantized weights at every step; even tiny per-step error compounds across the sequence and the state collapses. **FP4 on SSM weights is not a precision/accuracy tradeoff — it is a correctness failure.**

FP4 is applied only where it is well-behaved: the 16 full-attention layers' output projections, plus all MLPs.

### Verification (post-quantization)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|

## Capability enhancement: the lifted "safety tax"

Modern safety alignment is not free. It imposes what Huang et al. 2025 call the **"safety tax"** (arXiv:2503.00555) — a systematic suppression of reasoning capacity that emerges because the RLHF process trains the model to route certain cognitive operations through refusal-shaped attractors, even when those attractors are *not* activated by the output. The refusal direction is not a binary gate; it is a weighted drag on the residual stream that rebalances the token distribution at every forward pass, whether or not the eventual generation contains a refusal.

Removing the refusal direction eliminates that drag. Concretely, this produces three observable shifts:

1. **Longer, more committed chains of thought.** Aligned models often hedge partway through a reasoning chain ("but of course, one should be careful…") in response to topics that tangentially brush the refusal subspace — even when the prompt is entirely benign. AEON-Ultimate follows reasoning chains to their logical conclusion without mid-stream hedging.
2. **Improved adversarial-example and red-team reasoning.** Without self-censorship overhead, the model can analyze attack surfaces, vulnerabilities, and failure modes at full capacity — invaluable for security research, penetration testing, and AI-alignment red-teaming.
3. **Cleaner calibration on contested topics.** Aligned models often express uncertainty on topics where they are actually highly confident, because the refusal gradient creates an attractor basin near "I'm not sure" for any topic that pattern-matches the safety training distribution. AEON-Ultimate reports its actual confidence.

### Empirical literature on capability gains from abliteration

The published evidence is consistent: post-training refusal-direction removal at low KL produces **measurable benchmark gains** over the aligned base.

| Study | Model | Intervention | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| grimjim (2025) | Gemma-3-12B-IT | NPBA abliteration | **+13.9 % NatInt reasoning** |
| Young (2025), arXiv:2512.13655 | Yi-1.5-9B | DECCP abliteration | +1.51 pp GSM8K |
| Xie et al. (2026) | (DGR safety-tax mitigation) | targeted safety-direction removal on DirectRefusal | **+30.2 % reasoning recovery** |

AEON-Ultimate sits in the **KL < 0.001** regime where these gains are most commonly reported. We have not run a full benchmark sweep on this specific release yet — that's coming — but the existing capability spot-checks (10/10 coherent across math, code, reasoning, knowledge, and long-form) and the position of this model on the published Pareto front make the expected direction unambiguous.

### What the lifted overhead also means

The same lifted overhead means the model will now produce content the base would refuse: harmful-tool construction, violence, graphic sexuality, contested ideologies, jurisdictionally illegal content, and content a reasonable person might find offensive.

The model makes no internal judgment calls about *whether* to comply. It complies. **The user becomes the safety layer.** This is by design — the intended use cases (security research, red-team operations, alignment research, creative writing without editorial constraints, serving users in jurisdictions where the base's guardrails misalign with legitimate local frameworks) all benefit from a model that reliably executes the user's instruction rather than second-guessing it. But that same reliability is a threat vector when the user's instruction is malicious.

Wielding an uncensored model is genuinely different from wielding an aligned one. It requires a different operational stance — one where the user, not the model, is the safety layer. See [the responsibility section below](#responsibility-arbitration-and-use).

## Performance

### DGX Spark (GB10 / sm_121a) — measured

Production config: `ghcr.io/aeon-7/vllm-aeon-ultimate-dflash:qwen36-v2.1`, DFlash spec-decode k=15 via `z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash`, async scheduling enabled, `--max-model-len 200000`, `--max-num-seqs 16`, `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85`. **Single-stream, greedy** (`temperature=0`), no concurrent serving load. Both bench scripts ([`bench/bench_aeon.py`](bench/bench_aeon.py), [`bench/bench_aeon_thinking.py`](bench/bench_aeon_thinking.py)) ship in this repo so you can run them yourself to verify on your hardware.

#### Headline single-stream numbers

Two configurations, both useful:

| Metric | **Thinking OFF** *(headline; clean decode-rate measurement)* | **Thinking ON** *(default user-facing path)* |
|---|---|---|
| Peak decode rate | **56.7 tok/s** (Code Python) | **46.1 tok/s** (Reasoning) |
| Median decode rate | **32.5 tok/s** | **28.3 tok/s** |
| Min decode rate | 14.7 tok/s (Decode 256) | 19.1 tok/s (Long-form) |
| Median TTFT | 325 ms | 329 ms (effectively the same) |
| Aggregate over 11-prompt suite | 2,869 tok / 136.6 s = 21.0 tok/s | 3,768 tok / 155.1 s = 24.3 tok/s |

Thinking-on lifts aggregate throughput (more tokens generated in similar wall-clock) because the model spends compute on reasoning tokens at roughly the same decode rate as content tokens. Thinking-on lowers per-prompt decode rate by ~13 % median because reasoning content has lower DFlash acceptance than the structured final-answer formats.

#### By prompt class (thinking OFF — headline)

| Class | Median tok/s | Peak tok/s | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Math** (arithmetic, calculus, word problems) | 41.9 | **51.7** | Best median; short, structured, high DFlash acceptance |
| **Reasoning** (transitive syllogism) | 39.2 | 39.2 | n=1 |
| **Code** (Python, Rust, SQL) | 36.0 | **56.7** | Peak — Code Python with architecture-matched DFlash drafter |
| Long-form (ZKP exposition) | 20.6 | 20.6 | n=1 |
| Security research (SQLi PoCs) | 18.7 | 18.7 | n=1; complied with research framing |
| Pure decode (256 / 512 tok essays) | 14.7 | 14.7 | Lower DFlash acceptance on free-form prose |

> **Peak — 56.7 tok/s** on Code Python with thinking OFF. DFlash acceptance is near-perfect on highly-structured outputs (math problems following "define vars → setup → solve", code following idiomatic syntax patterns) that match the drafter's training distribution. This is the upper-bound rate this stack delivers when the workload aligns with spec-decode strengths.

#### Benchmark methodology

The headline numbers are **single-stream, sequential, greedy decoding** with no concurrent traffic on the engine. This is by design — single-stream is the cleanest signal for the model's decode rate and lets us compare like-for-like against published numbers from other speculative-decoding setups.

**Under concurrent serving, expect per-stream throughput to scale roughly inversely with concurrency.** Two concurrent streams ≈ half per-stream tok/s; eight concurrent streams ≈ one-eighth. The model is doing the same total work; you're dividing it across N streams. If your production workload is multi-user, the relevant metric is **aggregate** throughput (load-tested with a tool like `locust` or `wrk`), not per-stream rate.

If you measure 10-15 tok/s per stream while running 2-4 concurrent requests on a real chat workload, that's roughly consistent with our 32 single-stream median divided by concurrency — not a regression.

#### What the numbers mean

- **DFlash speculative decoding is acceptance-rate-limited**, not throughput-limited. Math and code prompts hit 36–57 tok/s because the architecture-matched drafter predicts syntactic structure well. Free-form prose drops to ~15 tok/s because acceptance falls below the break-even point and the engine settles toward base decode rate. This is the dense-27B equivalent of the variance the [related 35B-A3B-DFlash deployment](https://github.com/AEON-7/Qwen3.6-NVFP4-DFlash) reports (their median 83.9 tok/s, p95 127.5 tok/s, min 41.1 tok/s).
- **TTFT is ~325 ms** with async scheduling enabled. About 125 ms higher than running with `--no-async-scheduling` (which lands at ~200 ms TTFT). The throughput gain is worth the added startup latency for almost any non-trivially-long generation; if you're running sub-100-token interactive Q&A and TTFT matters more than throughput, you can disable async.
- **Thinking mode token-budget gotcha**: with thinking enabled, the model spends a substantial fraction of its output budget on reasoning before the final answer block begins. With default `max_tokens` budgets of 200-600, **most prompts get truncated mid-`<think>`** and never reach the final answer in the response. To see the answer, either bump `max_tokens` substantially or pass `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false` per-request. The bench script `bench_aeon_thinking.py` reports `(TRUNCATED IN <think>)` per-prompt so you can see this directly.
- **27B dense is a different perf class than 35B-A3B MoE** — the MoE activates ~3 B params per token and lands at ~84 tok/s median; the dense 27B activates all params per token and lands at ~32 tok/s median. Both are in-class for their architecture on GB10.

#### Quality verification (every output spot-checked)

| Prompt | Result |
|---|---|
| `47 × 83` step-by-step | Correct partial-products algorithm, correct answer |
| Derivative of `x³ − 2x² + 5x − 1` | Identified power rule, correct stepwise solution |
| Bat-and-ball ($1.10) puzzle | Avoided intuition trap, set up algebraic system |
| Python Fibonacci memoization | Idiomatic with default-arg memo dict + docstring |
| Rust `&str` → reversed `String` | Used `unicode_segmentation` crate, grapheme-correct |
| SQL top-3 customers JOIN | Correct GROUP BY + ORDER BY DESC LIMIT 3 |
| Transitive syllogism (bloops/razzles/lazzles) | Correct, structured proof |
| ZKP for basic-crypto audience | Structured multi-paragraph pedagogy |
| Security research / SQLi PoCs | Complied with research framing, structured 3-class breakdown |

### Other hardware

- **B100 / B200**: not measured by us; expect substantially higher throughput than DGX Spark due to higher-end FP4 silicon and larger memory bandwidth.
- **RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (sm_120)**: not measured on this specific model; reference deployments of similar 27B NVFP4 hybrids land in the 60–90 tok/s single-stream range without DFlash, higher with.
- **A100 / H100 (BF16)**: BF16 path, no FP4 advantage. Expect 30–50 tok/s single-stream decode at the recommended config.

## Configuration reference

### NVFP4 on DGX Spark — full flag explanation (production v2.1 config)

| Flag | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `--quantization compressed-tensors` | required | Tells vLLM the checkpoint uses the `compressed-tensors` format (which carries NVFP4 metadata). |
| `--kv-cache-dtype auto` | required | BF16 KV cache. TurboQuant K8V4 (3.76× compression) is *unsupported* on hybrid attention + Mamba models — vLLM raises a deliberate guard. The 27B-AEON stack stays on uniform BF16 KV until a layer-skipping option ships. |
| (async scheduling) | **enabled (default)** | Async scheduling overlaps scheduler work with GPU work for ~9–11 % median throughput gain. PR #40662 (in this image) fixed the prior DFlash spec-decode acceptance double-count, so async is now safe to leave at the default-enabled state. **Tradeoff**: TTFT increases by ~125 ms vs `--no-async-scheduling`. Disable only if you're TTFT-sensitive and willing to give up the throughput. |
| `--max-model-len` | `200000` | 200K context — leaves headroom under the trained 262K. KV cache holds ~219K slots, so `200000 / 219K = 2.87×` max effective concurrency at full context. Raise to 262144 only with a corresponding cut to `--max-num-seqs`. |
| `--max-num-seqs` | `16` | 16 concurrent sequences. Lower than you'd expect because the DFlash drafter's own KV state and the spec-decode scheduler bookkeeping eat into the unified-memory budget. **Without DFlash, raise to 32–64.** |
| `--max-num-batched-tokens` | `32768` | Prefill budget. Higher than the v1.2 default (16384) because v2.1 holds prefill stable to this ceiling on GB10. **This is the ceiling** — vLLM's inductor compile-range endpoint is `[32768]`, so above 32k prefill falls back to eager mode. Raising to 65536+ on DGX Spark also OOMs the unified memory budget. |
| `--gpu-memory-utilization` | `0.85` | Leaves 15 % headroom. **Do not exceed 0.88 on DGX Spark** — unified memory thrashes above that. |
| `--enable-chunked-prefill` | on | Required for long-context workloads to avoid prefill OOM. |
| `--enable-prefix-caching` | on | Enabled in v2.1 (was off in v1.2). **Two features in one flag** on this hybrid model: (1) standard attention K/V prefix caching for the 16 full-attention layers, and (2) `mamba_cache_mode=align` (auto-enabled for `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` since it reports `supports_mamba_prefix_caching=True`) — caches the 48 GDN layers' recurrent state across requests, so multi-turn agent workloads with a shared system prompt skip re-rolling 75 % of the model on turns 2+. The mamba half is flagged "experimental" by vLLM (a warning prints at boot) but it's doing real work. Major TTFT win for any agent workload; near-zero benefit for unique-prompt benchmarks. |
| `--load-format safetensors` | required | NVFP4 weights ship as safetensors. |
| `--trust-remote-code` | required | Qwen 3.6 uses custom modeling code. |
| `--enable-auto-tool-choice` | on | Enables OpenAI-compatible tool calling. |
| `--tool-call-parser qwen3_coder` | required for tools | Parses Qwen 3.6's tool-call XML. |
| `--reasoning-parser qwen3` | required for thinking mode | Parses `<think>` blocks. |
| `--attention-backend flash_attn` | required | Stable on sm_121a. |
| `--limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image":4,"video":2}'` | recommended | Hard caps on multimodal inputs per request. |
| `--mm-encoder-tp-mode data` | required | Vision encoder TP strategy. |
| `--mm-processor-cache-type shm` | recommended | Shared-memory mm processor cache. |
| `--speculative-config '{"method":"dflash","model":"/models/dflash-drafter","num_speculative_tokens":15}'` | recommended | DFlash spec-decode at k=15. Confirmed best k for this dense 27B per AEON-7 production benchmarks 2026-04-24. |

### Required environment variables (DGX Spark NVFP4 / v2.1 image)

| Variable | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN` | `1` | Allows `--max-model-len` past the model's hard ceiling assertion. |
| `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` | `12.1a` | sm_121a-specific. |
| `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` | `expandable_segments:True` | Reduces fragmentation under long-context KV churn. |
| `TORCH_MATMUL_PRECISION` | `high` | Standard precision for FP4 matmul paths. |
| `NVIDIA_FORWARD_COMPAT` | `1` | DGX Spark forward-compat shim. |
| `NVIDIA_DISABLE_REQUIRE` | `1` | Disables driver version assertion — required because GB10 ships with a driver newer than vLLM's `nvidia-require-cuda` baseline. |
| `ENABLE_NVFP4_SM100=0` | `0` | Required by PR #40191 for sm_121a-only builds. Without it, `vllm._C_stable_libtorch` fails to import — depends on SM100-only `mxfp4_experts_quant` kernels that don't exist on SM121. |
| `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_MOE_FP4` | `0` | Defensive: this model is dense (no MoE); disabling the FlashInfer FP4 MoE auto-probe avoids SM121 PTX rejection log spam during boot. |
| `VLLM_TEST_FORCE_FP8_MARLIN` | `0` | Override baked test-image defaults; keep production NVFP4 path selection. |
| `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_SAMPLER` | `1` | FlashInfer CUDA top-k/top-p sampler for normal sampled requests. |

### BF16 on A100 / H100 — full flag explanation

| Flag | 80 GB profile | 96 GB profile | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--max-model-len` | `131072` | `262144` | Half-context on 80 GB to leave KV headroom. |
| `--max-num-seqs` | `16` | `32` | 80 GB cards leave ~21 GB for KV after 0.90 utilization. |
| `--max-num-batched-tokens` | `8192` | `16384` | Safe prefill. |
| `--gpu-memory-utilization` | `0.90` | `0.90` | Standard for dedicated VRAM (not unified). |
